### **Season Breakdown: Dry vs. Rainy Seasons**

African safaris are heavily influenced by two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season. Each has its advantages, catering to different traveler preferences.

#### **Dry Season (June to October, December to February)**

The dry season is the most popular time for safaris, as it offers prime wildlife-viewing opportunities. During this period, animals gather around scarce water sources, making sightings frequent and predictable.

- **Highlights**:
  - Easier wildlife spotting as vegetation is sparse.
  - Comfortable weather with low humidity.
  - Peak migration events like the Great Wildebeest Migration in Maasai Mara.

#### **Rainy Season (March to May, November)**

The rainy season, or “green season,” transforms the landscape into a lush paradise. While wildlife can be harder to spot due to abundant water sources, the scenery and opportunities for photography are stunning.

- **Highlights**:
  - Migratory birds flock to the region, ideal for birdwatching.
  - Lower accommodation prices and fewer tourists.
  - Calving season in parks like Serengeti, offering glimpses of newborn animals.
